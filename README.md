<h1>Hi there, I'm Talhah</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I'm a computer science student at Toronto Metropolitan (formerly Ryerson) University. I enjoy working in a variety of fields, even if they're not CS-based. My interests currently lie in Software Development/Engineering and Data Analytics/Science.</p>
